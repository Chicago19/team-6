# Code for Good - Team 6

## Set up the dev env locally

Our project run using React.JS for the front-end and Express.JS for the backend. To get it running, install the following:

1. npm/npx (npx comes with npm)
2. nodemon; `npm install --save-dev nodemon`
3. react-scripts; `npm i react-scripts`
4. react-dom; `npm install react react-dom --save`
4. concurrently; `npm i concurrently`

Then, `cd` into the `parents` folder and run `npm run dev`.

##Troubleshooting

If you have any dependency errors, try removing `node_modules` with `rm -rf node_modules` and reinstall dependencies using `npm install`.
