# Code for Good - Team 6

## Set up the dev env locally

Our project run using React.JS for the front-end and Express.JS for the backend. To get it running, install the following:

1. npm/npx
2. nodemon
3. react-scripts
4. concurrently

Then, `cd` into the `parents` folder and run `npm run dev`.

##Troubleshooting

If you have any dependency errors, try removing `node_modules` with `rm -rf node_modules` and reinstall dependencies using `npm install`.
